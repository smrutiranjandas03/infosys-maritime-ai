## 📌 Project Overview

**FreightQuote AI** is an intelligent freight and logistics management platform developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship 7.0 – Batch 4, Milestone 2**.

The platform helps users manage freight operations, monitor shipments, analyze shipping routes, generate freight quotes, track vessels, identify weather and port congestion risks, and make data-driven logistics decisions.

It combines machine learning, AI-powered agents, real-time monitoring, and role-based access control to provide a unified logistics management solution.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Automate freight quotation and pricing processes.
- Monitor shipment progress and vessel movements.
- Analyze shipping routes and alternative sea routes.
- Identify port congestion and weather-related risks.
- Improve operational efficiency through AI-driven insights.
- Provide secure access through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Support better decision-making through analytics and reporting.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Freight Management
- Freight quote generation and management.
- Shipment tracking and status monitoring.
- Carrier information and comparison.
- Freight pricing and margin analysis.

### 2. AI-Powered Analytics
- AI Copilot for natural-language queries.
- Data-driven insights and recommendations.
- SQL-based analytical responses.
- Entity relationship and knowledge graph visualization.

### 3. Route Optimization
- Sea-route planning and analysis.
- Alternative route recommendations.
- Canal and strait avoidance options.
- Route distance and estimated transit-time calculations.

### 4. Weather & Risk Monitoring
- Weather condition monitoring.
- Port congestion analysis.
- Shipment delay-risk identification.
- Alternative route suggestions during adverse conditions.

### 5. Intelligent Agent System
The platform uses multiple specialized agents to monitor operations:

- Route Watch
- Weather Watch
- Customs Watch
- Quote Watch
- Anomaly Watch

These agents analyze operational data, identify potential issues, and generate actionable alerts.

### 6. Authentication & Security
- User registration and login.
- Password hashing using bcrypt.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Account lockout after repeated failed login attempts.
- Password recovery functionality.
- Secure session management.

### 7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The platform supports five user roles:

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Admin | Complete administrative control |
| Operations Manager | Operational monitoring and management |
| Freight Broker | Freight and quotation management |
| Auditor | Audit and monitoring access |
| Customer | Customer-specific information and services |

Access permissions are enforced on the server side to restrict unauthorized operations and protect customer-specific data.
